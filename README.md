Lies Kill: Case Zero is an **AI-driven murder mystery**

  The grand estate of the Duke de Valimont was once a palace of opulence, riches, and aristocracy. However, as of last night,
  its halls were filled with the bloody aftermath of a brutal murder. The Duke lies lifeless, and now five suspects remain to linger within the mansion.
  Each carries a potential motive, each cloaked in its twisted narratives. At least one of them knows the dark sinister reality of where they stood last night.

  As a private investigator summoned in the dead of night, you find yourself entangled with these perplexing figures. A storm rages outside, intensifying the suffocating tension that hangs thick in the air.
  Whispers of secrets shattered loyalties, and silent accusations fill every dimly lit corridor.
  Trust is a fickle companion... and nowhere to be found.

  Your mission: interrogate each suspect as they weave their tales. Detect the subtle lies hidden beneath layers of deceit. Observe their demeanor:
  Who shifts uncomfortably? Who speaks with an unsettling calm?

  The fabric of truth is a tapestry fraught with contradictions. Piece together their accounts to construct a timeline, a path leading you closer to the murderer's identity,
  But as you inch toward the truth, the mansion's walls seem to close in, the whispers grow louder... demanding justice... or thirst for more blood.

  The ultimate question looms: Can you unmask the killer before it's too late?
